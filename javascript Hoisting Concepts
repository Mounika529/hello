JAVASCRIPT Hoisting Concepts: 

 Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

There are 2 types of Hoisting they are 1)Variable Hoisting 2)Function Hoisting

1)Variable Hoisting: Where it take the memory pointer but not the variable.

Eg: function (){

    console.log(x);
 
    var x=15;

    }


2)Function Hoisting: Where you can shift the entire function where ever you want.

Eg: function foo(){

    var x=15;
    
    console.log(foo()){

    function foo(){

    return x;
  
    }
   
    foo();
  
    };
